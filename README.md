# My Resume
Hi, I am Emmanuel,

    I am a web developper in France, this is my resume and portfolio.

### Awesome Animation effect inspired by Kevin Powell. 
[https://www.youtube.com/kevinpowell](https://www.youtube.com/kevinpowell)
```css
    .style {
        mask-image : url(layers) ;
        mask-mode : ;
        mask-size : ;
        mask-position : ;
        position : absolute;
        animation : steps;
    }
```
### Implement the Animation Trigger with intersectionObserver
[MDN docs for intersectionObserver](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/IntersectionObserver/IntersectionObserver)
```js
    const observer = new intersectionObserver()
```

--------
### Call a REST API and use the data. 
Use the [Wikipedia REST API](https://doc.wikimedia.org/Wikibase/master/js/rest-api/) 
and GET endpoints `/article`, `/summary` , `/title` . 

```

--------
### My first AI generated application using Stackblitz Bolt. 
<!-- [Try Stackblitz Bolt](https://bolt.new/) -->

[AI generated app](https://bolt.new/~/stackblitz-starters-m8udfr)
The code was entirely generated within a few minutes, 
using a framework I never worked with before... Bolt is very impressive!
Even though the deployment process is not going as smoothly (Angular production build), I am sure it will be fixed.

    As many have already remarked, and I agree that the future of AI coding will be : 
    exponentially faster development cycles -> exponential amount of code -> exponential amount of bugs.
